# Purpose
This project aims to provide convenience for cat owners to identify and record their pets' like & dislike ingredients. It provides pros and cons of common food ingredients, so that the owners do not need to search online. The data in ingredient lists currently is small, but hope to include more ingredients in the future.

## How to use
1. Log in to the web, and then owners can add their cats/dogs in My Pets page. 
2. After adding your pets, owners can go to Search page to find ingredients by 4 categories - meat, grains, vegetable and supplements. 
3. Click to see details of this ingredient, and decide to add to certain pet's like or dislike list.
