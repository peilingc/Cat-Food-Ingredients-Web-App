# Purpose
This project aims to provides convenience for cat owners to record their pets' like & dislike ingredients. It also provides some details about common food ingredients, so that the owners do not need to search online. The data in ingredient lists currently is small, but hope to include more data in the future.

# How to use
After logging in to the web, first, owners can add cats in My Pets page. After adding your pets, owners can go to Search page to find ingredients by category. They can also click to see details of this ingredient, and decide to add to certain pets' like or dislike list.
